# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with LSTM (META)

This project builds and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the stock prices of **Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)** using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project follows the typical pipeline for time series prediction:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Download historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, scale, and prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Modeling**: Build and train an LSTM model to learn patterns in stock prices.
4. **Prediction**: Forecast future stock prices using the trained model.
5. **Visualization**: Plot and compare actual vs. predicted prices.
